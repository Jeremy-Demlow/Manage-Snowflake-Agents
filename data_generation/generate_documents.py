## Overview
Welcome to Alpine Peaks Resort! Your safety is our top priority. This guide covers essential information for a safe day on the mountain.

## Weather Zones
Our mountain is divided into four weather zones, each with unique conditions:

- **Summit Peak** (Elevation 11,500ft): Exposed to high winds, always check conditions before heading up via {LIFT_NAMES['L001']}.
- **North Ridge** (Elevation 10,800ft): North-facing slopes hold snow longer but can be icy in afternoon.
- **Alpine Bowl** (Elevation 10,200ft): Protected bowl with consistent conditions, accessed via {LIFT_NAMES['L007']}.
- **Village Base** (Elevation 8,500ft): Warmest zone, best for beginners using {LIFT_NAMES['L015']} and {LIFT_NAMES['L016']}.

## Trail Difficulty Ratings
- 🟢 **Green Circle**: Beginner - {', '.join(TRAIL_NAMES[:3])}
- 🔵 **Blue Square**: Intermediate - {', '.join(TRAIL_NAMES[3:8])}
- ⚫ **Black Diamond**: Expert - {', '.join(TRAIL_NAMES[8:12])}
- ⚫⚫ **Double Black**: Experts Only - {', '.join(TRAIL_NAMES[12:])}

## Lift Safety
- Always lower the safety bar when riding {LIFT_NAMES['L001']} (gondola) or any chairlift.
- Watch for download announcements on {LIFT_NAMES['L001']} during high winds.
- {LIFT_NAMES['L018']} (Backcountry Gate) requires avalanche safety gear and partner.

## Emergency Contacts
- Ski Patrol Emergency: Dial 911 from any lift or use orange emergency phones
- Non-emergency: Visit any Ski Patrol station
- Lost children: Report immediately to Guest Services at Village Base

## Your Responsibility Code
1. Always stay in control and be able to stop or avoid other people or objects.
2. People ahead of you have the right of way.
3. Do not stop where you obstruct a trail or are not visible from above.
4. Before starting downhill or merging, look uphill and yield.
5. If you are involved in or witness a collision, remain at the scene.
6. Always use devices to help prevent runaway equipment.
7. Observe all posted signs and warnings.

## Making the Case for Pass Holder Growth

### Current Pricing Structure
| Pass Type | Price | Break-Even Visits |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Adult Season Pass | $899 | 7 visits |
| Early Bird Pass | $699 | 5.4 visits |
| Family 4-Pack | $2,999 | 6 visits/person |
| College Pass | $549 | 4.3 visits |
| Senior Pass | $699 | 7 visits |

### Pass Holder Behavior Data
Based on analysis of our {int(PERSONA_DISTRIBUTION['local_pass_holder']*8000):,} local pass holders:

- **Average Visits per Season**: 32 days
- **Average F&B Spend per Visit**: $28
- **Rental Probability**: {int(PERSONAS['local_pass_holder']['rental_prob']*100)}%
- **Laps per Day**: {PERSONAS['local_pass_holder']['laps_range'][0]}-{PERSONAS['local_pass_holder']['laps_range'][1]}

### Total Lifetime Value Comparison
| Segment | Ticket Revenue | F&B Revenue | Other | LTV (3 year) |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| Pass Holder | $899/yr | $896/yr | $150/yr | $5,835 |
| Day Tripper | $387/yr | $60/yr | $180/yr | $1,881 |
| Weekend Warrior | $1,290/yr | $420/yr | $200/yr | $5,730 |

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Early Bird Window Extension**: Extend early bird pricing 2 weeks to capture holiday purchasers
2. **Add-On Bundles**: Offer F&B credits ($100 for $80) at pass purchase
3. **Referral Program**: $50 credit for each new pass holder referral
4. **Conversion Path**: 3-day pass purchasers get $100 off season pass

### Target: 40% Pass Holder Mix
Current: 35% of visits from pass holders
Goal: 40% by 2025-26 season

This would:
- Increase recurring revenue by $1.2M
- Improve visit predictability
- Reduce ticket window staffing needs
- Drive higher per-visit ancillary spending

### Related Campaigns

| Date | Trigger | Results |
|------|---------|---------|
| Dec 5 | 6" snowfall | 892 conversions |
| Dec 12 | 4" snowfall | 634 conversions (lower - threshold too low?) |
| Dec 19 | 8" snowfall | 1,247 conversions |
| Jan 3 | 10" snowfall | (Pending) |

**Recommendation**: Maintain 6" trigger threshold. 4" did not drive sufficient urgency.
