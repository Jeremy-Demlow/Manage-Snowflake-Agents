# VISITOR FORECASTER - DEV ENVIRONMENT OVERRIDES
# ============================================================================
# Faster iteration config - fewer features, simpler model
# Usage: FeatureEngineer.from_config('visitor_forecast', env='dev')
# ============================================================================

# Override: Use fewer features for faster training
include:
  - date_features      # Keep core date features
  - weather_features   # Keep weather features
  # - day_dummies      # Skip one-hot encoding for speed
  # - month_dummies    # Skip one-hot encoding for speed

# Exclude some weather features we don't need in dev
exclude:
  - is_high_wind
  - snow_condition_encoded

# Simpler lag features
lag_features:
  source: UNIQUE_VISITORS
  lags: [7, 14]         # Fewer lags for speed

# Simpler rolling features
rolling_features:
  source: UNIQUE_VISITORS
  windows: [7]          # Single window for speed
  aggregation: mean

# Faster hyperparams for dev iteration
hyperparams:
  n_estimators: 100     # Fewer trees
  max_depth: 4          # Shallower trees
  learning_rate: 0.1    # Faster learning
  early_stopping_rounds: 5

# Relaxed quality gates for dev
quality_gates:
  min_r2: 0.50          # Lower bar for dev
  max_mae: 300          # Allow higher error
  max_mape: 40.0
